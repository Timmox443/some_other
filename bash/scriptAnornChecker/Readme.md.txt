This script performs a series of checks to determine if certain programs are installed on the system. If they are not installed, the script will install them. The programs being checked and potentially installed are: AnonSurf, curl, grep, awk, sshpass, ssh, whois, nmap, and scp.

After the checks and installations are completed, the script verifies that the user's connection is anonymous via AnonSurf, and displays the spoofed country name. The user is then prompted to enter an IP address and a username. The script then prompts the user to enter a password, and uses sshpass to establish an SSH connection to the remote server.

Once the SSH connection is established, the script retrieves various details about the remote server, such as the country and IP address, using curl and uptime. The script also performs a Whois lookup on the specified IP address, and runs an nmap scan to determine open ports on the server.

After the data is collected, the script uses scp to copy the output files (whois_$target.txt and nmap_$target.txt) to the local computer. Finally, the script logs the data collection in a file named data_collection.log.
